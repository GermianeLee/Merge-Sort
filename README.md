The MergeSort.java program implements the Merge Sort algorithm, a stable and efficient *divide-and-conquer* sorting method.
It works by recursively splitting the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element (which is inherently sorted).
Then, it repeatedly merges these sorted subarrays back together in the correct order to form a fully sorted array. Merge Sort guarantees a 
time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases and is particularly useful when stable sorting is required, as it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
